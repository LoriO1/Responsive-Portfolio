      <p>
        Iâ€™ve always been extremely creative. In high school, my artwork placed
        2nd and 3rd, respectively, in two Illinois statewide competitions. I
        love branding, logo design, and organizing and streamlining business
        processes. My background includes strong
        skills in graphic design for large-format and specialty print, logo
        designs, and my art portfolio even includes 
            <a href="https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=376siagaz8g" id="interior" target="blank"
                alt="EMD Performance Materials - San Diego">commercial interior design</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, College of
        DuPage, and UCSD. In 2018, I earned my DMCP (Document Management
        Certified Professional), and am currently working towards a PMP
        (Project Management Professional) certification as well as a
        certificate from UCSD focusing in software and web app development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, my career goal is to combine my creative, technical, project management, and office skills into a comprehensive,
        well-rounded package that allows me to work seamlessly with any team.
